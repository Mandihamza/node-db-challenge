- Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.
> A relational database is a way of organizing data into tables, columns, and rows. SQL queries allow access to the data in the relational database.

- Why do tables need a `primary key`?
> Primary keys are used as unique identifiers for each record in a table. Primary keys are typically integers generated by the system. 

- What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
> Foreign keys reference primary keys.

- What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
> Joining (a.k.a bridging) tables are used to store columns which contain the primary keys from two tables.
